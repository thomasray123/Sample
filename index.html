<!-- <! -- We can group selectors by seperating them with a comma 
like this:
h1 , h2 {
    color:blue; 
}

--> 


<!-- <! -- Div tag is a block level tag which can be used to optimize elements in groups 
while span is an inline tag
--> 

<!-- <! -- For line height we can use 'em' like rem 'rem' for font size --> 


<!-- <! --  
For that thick plus cursor in css we can use 'cursor:cell;' to activate it
--> 


<!-- <! -- A block-level HTML element will always create a 
new line after the closing tag, whereas an inline HTML
 element will not. ... So, no matter how you organize 
 your HTML, block-level elements always create a new line.
 With an inline element, there is never a new line. 

To set an element as block level or inline level use 
'display:inline '
or
'display:block'
methods
